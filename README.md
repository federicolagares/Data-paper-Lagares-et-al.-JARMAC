# Data-paper-Lagares-et-al.-JARMAC
Data from these files were used for the article "The Effect of Handedness on Mental Arithmetic: a Longitudinal Large-scale Investigation through Smart Mobile Devices" by Lagares et al. that was submitted to the Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition.
The data was split into 10 files due to file size limits.

The variable "maxlevel" corresponds to the maximum level reached by each user in the game.

The variable “start_datenum” corresponds to the date in which each trial began to be played (you can also see the variables “start_datenum_year”, “start_datenum_month” and “start_datenum_day”).
We have added the variable "edad", which was calculated from the data of “start_datenum_year”, “start_datenum_month”, “start_datenum_day”, “birthdate_year”, “birthdate_month”, and “birthdate_day”.
